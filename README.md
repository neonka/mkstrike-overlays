# mkstrike-overlays
Free SimHub iRacing overlays. 

## Motivation
I think simulation game such as iRacing should support overlays like this without paying monthly subscriptions to third party apps.

## Support
If you want to support this work, you can buy me "coffee" here https://ko-fi.com/neonkadeveloper. All the support is appreciated.

## List of overlays:
- Standings *(supports multiple class races)*
- Relatives *(supports multiple class races)*
- Radar
- PIT stop limiter/info

> [!WARNING]
> Currently in BETA. Please excuse any mistakes, which will be fixed.
